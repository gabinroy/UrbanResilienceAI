# **App Name**: UrbanResilienceAI

## Core Features:

- Urban Vulnerability Index: Develop a composite index integrating NASA Earth observation data (Land Surface Temperature, aerosol/NO2 levels, vegetative indices) with city census and infrastructure data to identify vulnerable populations and areas.
- Ecosystem Service Modeler: Utilize remote sensing data to quantify the protective benefits of Green and Blue Infrastructure (cooling effect of parks, flood reduction by permeable surfaces).
- Climate-Resilient Strategies Tool: Use AI to propose data-informed planning recommendations (optimal placement for cooling centers, green infrastructure investment, building codes) demonstrating quantifiable improvements in wellbeing and environmental health, reasoned from the UVI and ESM.
- Data Integration Pipeline: Automate the process of collecting and processing relevant Earth observation data from NASA and merging it with urban datasets.
- Interactive Mapping: Visualize urban vulnerability, ecosystem services, and proposed strategies on an interactive map with various layers and filters.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#228B22) to evoke nature and sustainability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), for a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to represent water resources and a sense of openness.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, for a modern, tech-forward feel; Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for readability.
- Use clear, simple icons representing environmental factors, infrastructure, and social indicators.
- Employ a grid-based layout with intuitive navigation and information hierarchy.
- Incorporate subtle animations to highlight data changes and guide users through the analysis process.
